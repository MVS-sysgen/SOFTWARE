*
*
*  Prerequisite: User Modifications <PREREQS>
*  ===================================================================
*
*     Two user-mods, ZP60014 and ZP60038, are REQUIRED to process
*  CLIST symbolic variables via the IKJCT441 API on MVS 3.8J before
*  using LISTDSJ.  Otherwise, LISTDSJ is rendered useless!
*
*     More information on the above user-mods can be obtained from
*  the following website:
*       http://www.prycroft6.com.au/vs2mods/
*
*     If the above user-mods are not installed, a system abend 806-4
*  will occur when LISTDSJ is executed.  Additionally, an error
*  message will be displayed on your TSO session screen:
*      'LISTDSJ 4098 -Cannot link to IKJCT441'
*
*     Check your system to determine if one or both user-mods are
*  required.  ZP60038 requires ZP60014.
*
*
*     Although not a prerequisite, ISPLINK is called for table services
*  to create PDS member lists via the LISTDSJ DLn option if ISPF is
*  installed on MVS38J such as ISPF 2.0 (Wally Mclaughlin's product).
*  If a member directory list option (DL0 or DL1) is requested
*  and MVS38J does not have ISPF installed, the option is ignored.
*  However, MVS38J will report a system abend 806-4 for program
*  ISPLINK when the LISTDSJ request is processed.  This is by design.
