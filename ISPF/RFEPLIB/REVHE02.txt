 ¢REVEDIT+is a fullscreen editor and a component of¢REVIEW.+
 ¢REVEDIT+is not a TSO command, but the¢REVEDIT+HELP member will be
  accessed when HELP is requested in a non-ISPF environment.

 ¢REVEDIT+allows the editing of MVS data sets residing on direct
  access storage devices (DASD) which may contain records which have
  a fixed-length or variable-length format.  Currently only non-VSAM
  is supported.

  Under MVS/ESA and later (including OS/390 and z/OS) data being
  edited is held in a data space which can grow with the data up to
  two (2) gigabytes in size subject to installation limits implemented
  either by design (eg. system exits) or circumstance (eg. insufficient
  auxiliary storage to allow processing to continue).

   Syntax -
        %UPDATE+
     or, if not in an ISPF environment
        %EDIT+
)INIT
)PROC
)END
