%  RIGHT    +- Scroll to the RIGHT a specified number of columns.
            +  If no operand is specified, the 'scroll' value is used.
%  LOCATE   +- Display the specified record number.
            +  (Relative record number only, not sequence numbers.)
%  HEX ON   +- Display the screen in hexadecimal.
%  HEX OFF  +- Display the screen in character mode.
%  HEX      +- If HEX currently on, turn it off.  If off, turn it on.
%  FIND     +- Search until the specified data or pattern is found.
%  FINDSMF  +- Search for an SMF record type and optionally sub-type.
%  FINDNOT  +- Search until the specified data or pattern is not found.
%  IFIND    +- Repeat the previous FIND or FINDNOT operation.
%  RESET    +- Deactivate line exclusion caused by the ALL or REST

%  ASCII ON +- Specifies that ASCII data is being¢REVIEWed+and that
            +  characters are to be translated to EBCDIC before being
            +  displayed.  Note that search arguments to the 'FIND' and
            +  'FINDNOT' commands typed in while in ASCII mode are
            +  translated to ASCII.
%  ASCII OFF+ - Leave the characters to be displayed in EBCDIC.
%  ASCII    +- If ASCII is on, turn it off.  If off, turn it on.
%  DISP T   +- Display TN/T11-like EBCDIC text characters where possible.
            +  This is similar to 3278T in ISPF.

            +  as the top-of-data.  This is useful for looking past
            +  I/O errors, end-of-file markers, and at deleted members.
            +  It is also useful for directly viewing data a long way
            +  from the start without reading all the preceding records.
%  SUBMIT   +- Submit the file or MEMBER being¢REVIEWed.+
            +  TSO SUBMIT is invoked.
            +  The data set must be sequential or partitioned,
            +  and have fixed length 80-byte records.

%  FMTVAR   +- Manually specify the data type of a data item.
%  APPEND   +- Copy¢REVIEWed+data starting from the first record shown
            +  on the screen to an output file.  Data is to be appended
            +  to any existing data in the output file.
%  COPYOUT  +- Copy¢REVIEWed+data starting from the first record shown
            +  on the screen to an output file.  Any data in the output
