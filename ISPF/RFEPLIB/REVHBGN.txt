+
+The¢REVIEW+command allows a data set or UNIX entity to be examined at a
+3270 TSO terminal in full screen mode.  Both disk and tape files may be
+REVIEWed.  Load module members with a residence mode of ANY are shown
+in high intensity or green in the member list.  SCLM-managed members
+are flagged with an equals ('=') sign in the member list.  When looking
+at file data, a 'K' may be shown in the "ruler" heading line to denote
+the first and last, or only, column(s) of VSAM record keys.  On color
+terminals the portion of the "ruler" line corresponding to record keys
+is shown in red.  If the record format indicates printer carriage
+control characters then an 'A' or an 'M' as appropriate may be shown in
+column 1 of the "ruler" heading line.
+
¢REVIEW+can format records according to Assembler data structure
+source code supplied by the user. ¢REVIEW+can also format system
+related data such as SMF records, EREP data, VTOC entries, tape
+labels and load module structure and identification data. ¢REVIEW+
+can format the directories of ZIP files created by PKZIP, Info-ZIP,
+WinZIP, etc.
+
¢REVIEW+can display the history of program objects residing in PDSE
+data sets or UNIX files, including compilation and program bind
+timestamps.
+
¢REVIEW+can display pictures in 1-bit (black-and-white), 4-bit
+(16 colors) and 8-bit (256 colors) single-plane ".PCX" (ZSoft
+Paintbrush) files on a terminal with 3270 graphics capabilities.
+
¢REVIEW+can display pictures in 1-bit (black-and-white), 4-bit
+(16 colors), 8-bit (256 colors), 16-bit (high color), 24-bit or
+32-bit (true color) uncompressed single-plane ".BMP" (Windows or
+OS/2 Bitmap) files on a terminal with 3270 graphics capabilities.
+
+(Colors in color pictures will be coarsely rendered in 3270 colors.)
+
¢REVIEW+can process a single data set or a pre-allocated file
+concatenation.  Partitioned files can be sequentialized,
+offloaded in PDSLOAD (IEBUPDTE-like) format, or searched for
+specific or picture-masked data.  Load modules can be offloaded
+into a sequential format, and can be delinked into object decks.
+Sequential offload files can be processed to restore members
+into partitioned data sets.
+
¢REVIEW+can process the system PARMLIB concatenation.
+
¢REVIEW+has three (3) different directory displays.  They are:
+    1)%PDS+type - for a PDS, a data PDSE, and concatenated
+       files of any sort of PDS and/or PDSE.
+    2)%PDSE+type - for an unconcatenated program object PDSE.
+    3)%UNIX+type - for UNIX directories and files in
+       hierarchical file structures.
+
¢REVIEW+can process UNIX files such as HFS (Hierarchical File System)
+files.
+
¢REVIEW+allows access to, and the saving of, data by data content,
+data beyond I/O errors and end-of-file markers, and data from
+deleted members of a PDS.
+
¢REVIEW+can convert ASCII data to EBCDIC.
+
¢REVIEW+can be invoked recursively by using the TSO subcommand.
+Swapping between parallel sessions allows access to any nested
+REVIEW session without requiring the termination of any other
+REVIEW session.
+
+The 'REVED' command is a way of invoking¢REVIEW+and setting the
+default action for non-VSAM data sets to edit with REVEDIT instead
+of browse with REVIEW.  Using REVED with a sequential data set
+name immediately starts a REVEDIT session.  Using REVED with a
+partitioned data set name alters the meaning of the 'S' selection
+code to mean edit (with REVEDIT) rather than browse (with REVIEW).
