  ¢REVEDIT+allows you to scroll up and down through the data. If the data is
   too wide to fit on the screen, you can also scroll left and right.

   To scroll, enter one of the six scroll commands (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT,
   TOP or BOTTOM).  Minus, plus, less than, and greater than signs are aliases
   for UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT.

   To change the number of lines or columns being scrolled, change the
   scroll amount field.

 The following topics will be presented only if selected by number:
    %1+- Scroll commands
    %2+- Scroll amount
