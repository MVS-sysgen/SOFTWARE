   The%END+subcommand terminates the¢REVIEW+command, or, if in member
   selection mode, returns to the member selection list.  The member
   selection list may be bypassed with the EXIT subcommand.

   The%EXIT+subcommand terminates the¢REVIEW+command, bypassing the
   member selection list.

   The%CANCEL+subcommand performs the same processing as the END subcommand
   without saving the¢REVIEW+user profile to disk.  The¢REVIEW+user
   profile (which contains data display colors, scrolling amount and 24 PF
   Key values) is normally only rewritten to disk at the END of a¢REVIEW+
   session if it has been changed during that session.  If a member list has
   not been displayed in a session then the¢REVIEW+session is terminated
   without saving the user profile.  If a member list has been shown it is
   reshown but the user profile is no longer considered to have been
   altered, even though the profile "in-core" still has the changes applied
   to it.  Changing the profile at this stage and exiting will cause all
   accumulated profile changes for the¢REVIEW+session to be saved to disk
   unless another CANCEL is issued.
