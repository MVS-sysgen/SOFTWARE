+ %Operands+-
+
+ %'dsname'+or%'dsname(member)'+- The data set to be examined.
+ %'filename'+- The DDNAME allocated to the data set to be examined.
+ %'pathname'+- The path name of an UNIX directory.
+
+  If the first operand begins with a slash ('/') then it is deemed to
+  specify an UNIX directory path, and no other operands are allowed.
+  A specific UNIX file may be specified to directly access the data
+  contained in the file.
+
+  If the first operand does not begin with a slash then it is assumed
+  to be a DSNAME unless it is followed by the keyword 'FILE'.
+
+  Specifying the quoted dsname of 'FORMAT4.DSCB' and a VOLUME
+  requests that the VTOC of that volume be REVIEWed.
+
+  Specifying the file name of PARMLIB when there is no PARMLIB
+  allocated on a OS/390 1.2 or later system requests that the
+  logical PARMLIB service be used to¢REVIEW+the system PARMLIB
+  concatenation.
+
+  If no operands are supplied then¢REVIEW+reads the screen image
+  and extracts the data set name from the part of the screen
+  containing the cursor.  This works in both fullscreen and line
+  modes, but not under Session Manager which updates the screen
+  before¢REVIEW+receives control.  If a data set name is not found
+  then normal TSO prompting is commenced except for a recursive
+ ¢REVIEW+session where a message is displayed.
+
+  A member name is NOT considered part of the data set name for
+  "point and shoot" purposes.
+
+  A UNIX path name cannot be processed by "point and shoot".
+
%FILE     +- This keyword indicates that the first operand is
+            a FILENAME, not a DSNAME.  This is useful for looking
+            at a temporary data set or at concatenated libraries.
+            A member name may be specified in the first operand
+            after the DDNAME if the DDNAME is allocated to a
+            PDS.  This allows you to enter 'REVIEW SYSPROC(X) F'
+            to look at member 'X' in whatever PDS is allocated to
+            DDNAME 'SYSPROC'.
+
+            Note that REVIEWing a concatenated sequential file may
+            cause unexpected behaviour.
+
+            The 'FILE' operand may be abbreviated to 'F'.
+
%VOLUME('volume')+- For uncataloged data sets, the volume serial.
+
+            'VOLUME' may be abbreviated to 'V'.
+
%UNIT('unit')+- For uncataloged data sets, the unit type.
+            This operand is ignored if 'VOLUME' is not specified.
+            If 'VOLUME' is specified the default unit is 'SYSALLDA'.
+            For data sets accessed via the catalog, the unit is
+            determined from the catalog entry.
+
+            'UNIT' may be abbreviated to 'U'.
+
%TOP('rel-addr')+- This specifies a relative address within the
+            data set to be considered as the logical top-of-data.
+            'TOP' performs the same function as the 'NEWTOP'
+            subcommand before the initial display of data.  As with
+            'NEWTOP', 'rel-addr' is a 1 to 6 hexadecimal digit
+            number interpreted as a TTR for disk data sets, or as
+            a BLOCK IDENTIFIER for tape data sets.  When 0 is
+            specified or defaulted to, no special action is taken.
+            This operand is ignored for VSAM and subsystem data sets.
+
+            'TOP' may be abbreviated to 'T'.
+
%TTR('rel-addr')+- Same as TOP('rel-addr').
+
%SUBSYS('subsys')+- For subsystem data sets, this specifies the 1-4
+            character subsystem name.  The subsystem must be active
+            and allow data set allocation for this to be successful.
+            The subsystem data set name specified may include a
+            member name in parentheses if appropriate.
+            This operand is ignored if 'VOLUME' is specified.
+
+            'SUBSYS' may be abbreviated to 'S'.
+
%QUICK    +- This indicates that if an unquoted data set name was
+            specified then the name was fully qualified apart from
+            the prefix (ie. no trailing qualifier has to be added).
+            This saves a search of the catalog to look for trailing
+            qualifiers which is otherwise performed unconditionally
+            unless the 'VOLUME' operand was specified.  This operand
+            is ignored if 'VOLUME' is specified.
+
+            The 'QUICK' operand may be abbreviated to 'Q'.
+
%DATA     +- This operand has several uses which, in general, mean
+            that control data is displayed rather than interpreted.
+            Specifically, this operand has seven (7) different
+            functions depending upon the type of data set being
+            REVIEWed.
+
+            1) For a VSAM component -
+               'DATA' indicates that control interval information
+               and DB2 tablespace structure is not to be interpreted
+               and that physical blocks are to be shown as-is without
+               extracting logical records or rows.
+
+            2) For a VSAM KSDS (Key-Sequenced Data Set) cluster -
+               'DATA' indicates that records are to be presented in
+               RBA (Relative Byte Address) or physical order rather
+               than in key-sequence order.
+
+            3) For a partitioned data set -
+               'DATA' indicates that the PDS directory is to be
+               REVIEWed as a sequential file, thereby precluding
+               access to the contents of members.
+
+            4) For other disk files with fixed length records -
+               'DATA' indicates that direct access logic which can
+               speed up access to different parts of the file will
+               not be used.  This logic is employed by default when
+               RECFM=F, RECFM=FS, or RECFM=FBS unless 'DATA' is
+               specified.  It is also used when RECFM=FB and the
+               VTOC indicates more than 256 tracks of data unless
+               'DATA' is specified.
+               (If this direct access logic is used and the file
+               does not use standard blocking, incorrect line
+               numbers and/or I/O errors could possibly occur.
+               The 'NEWTOP' subcommand (without any operand)
+               can be used from within¢REVIEW+to make¢REVIEW+
+               start behaving as if 'DATA' had been specified.)
+
+            5) For a SUBSYSTEM data set with a member included -
+               'DATA' indicates that a sequential file will be
+               allocated to the specified member only and data from
+               other members will not be accessible.  Use the 'DATA'
+               operand if the subsystem data set has members but the
+               subsystem does not support partitioned access.
+               (Normally, if 'DATA' was not specified then data from
+               the nominated member would initially be displayed,
+               but data from other members could subsequently
+               be displayed by using the 'MEMBER' subcommand.)
+
+            6) For a ZIP file 'DATA' indicates that the ZIP directory
+               will not be formatted, but that normal sequential read
+               and display processing will take place.  Only DASD
+               sequential data sets and UNIX files are checked for
+               ZIP format by REVIEW.
+
+            7) For a PCX (Paintbrush) file 'DATA' indicates that
+               picture data is not to be interpreted, but that normal
+               data display processing will take place.  Without the
+               'DATA' operand¢REVIEW+would attempt to display the
+               picture image contained in 1-bit, 4-bit or 8-bit color
+               single-plane PCX file.  (The 'FORMAT OFF' subcommand
+               can be used from within¢REVIEW+to instruct¢REVIEW+to
+               discard the picture data and therefore no longer show
+               the picture image.  A subsequent 'NEWTOP' subcommand
+               could be used to reactivate the image display.)  PCX
+               files are recognised by data content when the first
+               record is at least 80 bytes long.  The rendering of
+               pictures is never attempted when¢REVIEW+is running as
+               an ISPF application.
+
+            The 'DATA' operand may be abbreviated to 'D'.
+
%XISPMODE+- This specifies that¢REVIEW+
+            1) is not to act as an ISPF application and is therefore
+               to perform terminal I/O and subcommand processing
+               natively; and
+            2) is not to determine terminal capabilities from ISPF
+               variables but is to issue a Read Partition (Query)
+               itself if appropriate.
+
+            This operand will only affect processing in an ISPF
+            environment.
+
+            The second function listed above relates to detecting
+            the graphics capabilities of the TSO terminal.  If you
+            want¢REVIEW+to render graphic images (pictures) in an
+            ISPF environment then the XISPMODE operand is required
+            so that¢REVIEW+will detect that the terminal can handle
+            graphics.  Without this operand,¢REVIEW+determines
+            color, highlighting and graphics escape support from
+            ISPF, does not perform terminal I/O for a Query, and
+            can therefore present non-graphic file data more rapidly.
+
+            The 'XISPMODE' operand may be abbreviated to 'X'.
