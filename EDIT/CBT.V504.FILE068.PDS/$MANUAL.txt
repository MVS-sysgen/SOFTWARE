:p.
:i1.TSTVS
.pa
:h2.Introduction
:p.
TSTVS is developed for editing PDS member if TSO/VTAM is not available.
It is a product of Skybird Systems.
TSTVS communicates with the MVS master console operator.
:h3.Input and output
:p.
INP01 and OUTP01. Both ddnames are dynamically allocated.
:h2.Startup of TSTVS
:p.
:i1.Userid
:i1.Password
At startup, TSTVS asks for an authorized userid + a password (msg
EDT301A and EDT302A). With this userid and password, TSTVS will perform
a RACROUTE REQUEST=VERIFY/RACINIT with terminalname=LUTSTVS.
:p.
After verification of the user+password+terminal, the resource $TSTVS
in the FACILITY class will be checked. In A RACF-system the user should
be connected to this profile. In an ACF2 system, a generalized resource
should have been created. The resource type must be defined in
the GSO CLASMAP record (e.g. SAFMAPS(FAC/FACILITY)).
:p.
:i1.ACF2
:i2.CLASMAP
:i1.RACF
:i2.FACILITY
If no RACF or ACF2 is active (or stopped), TSTVS will bypass the
security check and will ask for the program password (msg EDT310A).
Refer to the responsible systems programmer
for the correct password.
.pa
:h2.Allocating datasets
:p.
If you start TSTVS the msg EDT200A Enter command or 'HELP'
appears after the security check.
:p.
:i1.Allocation
If you reply EDT200A with 'ALLOC' the monitor
prompts with 'EDT100A Enter dataset name or 'CANCEL'', which
should be replied with a dsname of max. 44 bytes or the word 'CANCEL'
If the reply is 'CANCEL', the ALLOC function will be terminated.
msg EDT198I en EDT200A will appear.
After this reply the question 'EDT101A Enter volume serial or 'U'
appears, which should be replied with a max 6 positions long volume
number or 'U'. If you reply 'U' the catalog is searched.
:p.
If these two replies are ok, the msg 'EDT103I Allocation of dataset
is successful'  will appear, otherwise a suitable error
message will be produced. (see messages)
:p.
If you have finished with this library you can allocate another
library with ALLOC. (The previous library is automaticly freed).
Other possible replies on msg EDT200A are.

:h2.Renaming datasets
:p.
:i1.RENAME
:h3.RENAME a catalogued dataset
:p.
The reply on msg :hp2.EDT200A Enter command or 'HELP':ehp2. should
be replied with 'RENAME'. After this, reply :hp2.EDT100A Enter dataset
name or 'CANCEL':ehp2. with a name of a catalogued
dataset and reply :hp2.EDT101A
Enter volume serial or 'U':ehp2 with an 'U'
:p.
Now reply the next msg :hp2.EDT106A Enter NEW dataset name or 'CANCEL'
:ehp2. with a newname. This name should not exist in any catalog.
:p.
After RENAME, the message :hp2.EDT199I RENAME of dataset successul
:ehp2. or a suitable error message should appear.
:h3.RENAME a not catalogued dataset
:p.
The only difference between RENAME of a not catalogued dataset
and a catalogued dataset (see previous chapter) is the reply on
msg EDT101A.
:p.
This message should be replied with a valid and online volume
serial number. After reply of msg EDT106A, the dataset will be
renamed on that volume.
:p.
:lblbox.Note!
If msg EDT101A has been replied with a volume serial number
and the dataset is catalogued, the catalog entry is NOT renamed.
:elblbox.
:h2.List the directory of a PDS
:p.
:i1.Partitioned dataset
A listing of the directory of the allocated PDS will be
displayed, if the reply on msg EDT200A is 'PDSLIST' or
'PDSLIST,key',
If the reply is 'PDSLIST', a list of the directory is displayed
upon the console.
If the reply is 'PDSLIST,key', a list of directory-entries is
displayed, starting with the membername beginning with 'key'.
When 'key' is not present the list begins with next higher key.
:lblbox.Note
If you enters 'PDSLIST' or 'PDSLIST,key' and
there are more than 16 lines the msg 'EDT017A
SHOULD TSTVS CONTINUE THIS FUNCTION ? REPLY Y
OR N' appears. If you reply with 'Y' the function
continues. With reply 'N' the function is terminated
with msg EDT018I (see messages).
:elblbox.
.pa
:h2.Create a member
:p.
Message 'EDT200A Enter command or 'HELP'
must be replied with 'A membername' or 'AN membername'
If the specified name is already present in the library,
the data can be overwritten.
:p.
Now appears message 'EDT003A Enter data, 'SAVE' or 'SUBMIT''
The 'data' needs no comment
R xx,SAVE is to save the data in the member
The messages EDT026A and EDT200A will be given.
R xx,SUBMIT is save the data and submit the job
to the JES2 internal reader.
:i1.JES2
After the action EDT200A appears.
If msg EDT003A has been replied with 'SAVE' or 'SUBMIT', the user
will be prompted with the message:
'EDT026A enter new name to save your workarea or reply
'U' to save your workarea in member xxxxxxxx'
If you reply with a 'newname' the member is saved under that
name. With reply 'U' the member is saved under the name, which
has been replied on the message EDT200A.
:p.
If the reply on msg EDT003A has been replied with a input stmnt,
then appears the msg 'EDT004A Enter sequence number', if the msg
EDT200A has been replied with 'AN membername'
After these messages the msg 'EDT003A Enter data ..' appears
again to type in your next statement.
:p.
If all the statements are typed in, you can reply msg EDT003A
with 'SAVE' or 'SUBMIT'
:p.
After 'SAVE' or 'SUBMIT' appears first msg EDT026A to save your
member and then msg EDT200A.
.pa
:h2.Update a member
:p.
If the message 'EDT200A Enter command .....' has been replied with
'U membername' or 'UN membername', you get into the 'subcommand mode'
of TSTVS.
:p.
The subcommand mode is anounced with the message 'EDT005A Enter
subcommand OR 'HELP''.
:p.
The subcommands are:
:h3.LIST xxxx-yyyy
:p.
With this subcommand you are able to list the changed contents
of the member.
The first 55 bytes of each record are displayed.
:p.
If you enters only 'LIST' the entire member is listed.
:p.
With 'LIST xxx' (xxx represents a single linenumber) you get
a display of that particular line.
With 'LIST xxxx-yyyy' (xxxx-yyyy represents a linenumber range)
you get a display of that line range.
:p.
:lblbox.Note
Note: If you list more than 16 lines, the message 'EDT017A
should TSTVS continue this function? reply Y or N' will be given
With reply 'Y' the function continues, with reply 'N' the function
terminated with msg 'EDT018I function terminated by operator'
(see messages).
:elblbox.
:p.
An alias of 'LIST' is 'L'.
:h3.XLST xxxx-yyyy
:p.
This subcommand is the same as LIST and has the same operands,
The difference is, that the entire record will be
displayed (80 positions).
Each record will be displayed in two lines. Line 1 displays
the columns 1-40. Line 2 displays columns 41-80.
:h3.PRINT 'class'
:p.
With this function the changed contents of the member is
printed in a spin-off SYSOUT=class dataset.
Default is SYSOUT=C.
:h3.SUBMIT
:p.
With this subcommand, the changed contents of the member has been
submitted to the JES2 internal reader.
:i1.JES2
:h3.RENUM
To renumber the linenumbers in cols 73-80 starting with
00000010 and an increment of 10.
:p.
The user will be notified with message 'EDT013I dataset has been
re-numbered' after successful RENUM.
:h3.UNNUM
:p.
With this subcommand you are able to remove the linenumbers
in columns 73-80. The linenumbers are replaced by blanks.
:h3.I xxxx
:p.
:i1.Insert
With this subcommand you are able to insert a line in the member.
xxxx represents a line number. After this line the line will be
inserted.
if you omit the linenumber in the 'I' subcommand the line
is inserted before line 1.
:p.
After the subcommand the msg 'EDT003A Enter data....'
appears to type in the data of the inserted line eventually
followed by msg 'EDT004A Enter sequence number' (Depends on reply
'U membername' or 'UN membername' on msg EDT200A Enter command..).
:h3.D xxxx or D xxxx-yyyy
:p.
Line xxxx or linenumber range xxxx-yyyy are deleted from the
member.
:h3.R xxxx
:p.
:i1.Repeat
With this subcommand you are able to duplicate the line
specified with 'xxxx'. If you omit the linenumber ('xxxx')
in the subcommand the first line is repeated.
:h3.V ON/OFF
:p.
V ON is list changed line after the 'C' subcommand, V OFF is don't
list after the 'C' subcommand.
:h3.END
:p.
Terminate 'subcommand mode'.   EDT200A appears.
:lblbox.Note
If you have made updates and you haven't saved, the

:p.
:ol.
:li.The linenumbers in the operands of the subcommands are
generated by the program TSTVS and are max four positions long
(Leading zeroes may be omitted).
These numbers are not physically in the data and are visible
if you enter a 'LIST', 'XLST' or 'PRINT' subcommand.
The connection of linenumber and line change, when you enter
a 'I', 'R' or 'D' subcommand. (The first line is always 1 and the
increment is always 1).
:li.The maximum of lines is 3999.
:p.
During updating of a member with more than 3999 lines, the
first 3999 lines are read and saved. (be careful).
