run  testcomp (which submits bep, bes, bkp, bks, brr, d's, pgm)
run  testload
run  testrun
run  testdone

since testcomp submits itself, you can't just submit comp, load,
run, done - 'cause load, run, and done will finish before the
compiles testcomp submits are run. to fix this, instead:
run  testall

-- tests may **NOT** leave files as they were, so it is always necessary to
(re)run TESTLOAD before running TESTRUN...

-- added CRNOTE to top of each pgm.

-- added pgm name to 'expecting' msgs

-- added logging to SYSO via KLOGIT -- however - if all is as 'expected'
there will be nothing logged, so SYSO won't exist...

-- added abort for bad aid (likely CLEAR at eof) for CRLP.  **NOTE** use of
eibtrmid 'CRLP to determine terminal **type** is not very good, I should use
exec as sign to obtain terminal type, but I didn't want to do that 'cause it
would just clutter up KEDF reporting

-- made screen msg/wait for 'expecting' msgs dependant on CRLP (see above note
on eibtrmid).

-- syncpoint added for pf12 so that files will always close when a test is done.
this to ensure 'path' tests and base cluster tests don't interfer with each
other (since you can't have both an upgrade path and a base cluster acb open
at once).

-- scripting -- don't use PF1 (rtn tranid) 'cause it will absorb another aid.
for example,

<pf1> rtn tranid
<pf3> do next master menu function

will fail. you'd need to code

<pf1> rtn tranid
<enter> (or something) to return to the TEST transaction
<pf1> do next master menu function

all in all, easier to just do a <pf12> xctl, and that's OK now with the
SYNCPOINT added...
