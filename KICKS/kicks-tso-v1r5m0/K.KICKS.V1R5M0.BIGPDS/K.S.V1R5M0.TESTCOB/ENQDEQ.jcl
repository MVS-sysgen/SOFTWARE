      * those apps in CICS.
      * You don't even need CICS itself installed on your machine!

      * then what is actually enqueued is the ADDRESS, and different
      * KICKS's won't have the same things at those addresses hence
      * enqueues across different KICKS's make no sense, so no MVS
      * enqueues (or dequeues) are done for such.

      * However, as below, when length IS specified the enqueue is
      * based on the string value contents of the resource specified,
      * in this case 'TESTCOB  WORKING STORAGE', and MVS enqueues
      * (and dequeues) ARE done.

      * MAXDELY parameter (default 3 minutes). If it still can't get
      * the enqueue you'll get an abend resp=55, resp2=999. This is
      * probably different from what happens in your real CICS, which
      * by default will wait forever, but probably has a local exit
      * to do ??something?? else.
