The following excerpts for SVC 99 Return Codes is from IBM's
GC28-0627-2 OS/VS2 MVS System Programming Library Job Mgmt manual.

A portion of this manual (pages 27-32) contain relevant SVC 99
return codes, reason codes and other descriptive information.

CCOMPR may generate error message CMPR000E during allocating or
unallocating a temporary file in this format:

    CMPR000E RC=0012 Alloc1 OUT       ERR=0860 INFO=0002
    CMPR000E RC=rrrr Unalloc1 DD-OUT  ERR=eeee INFO=iiii
    CMPR000E RC=rrrr xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx ERR=eeee INFO=iiii

    rrrr - RC in decimal value, see below (SVC 99 Return Codes list)
           for description.

    eeee - ERR in decimal value, convert to hex,
           see attached except of GC28-0627-2 OS/VS2 MVS Sys Pgm
           manual for full description.

    iiii - INFO in decimal value, represents error class,
           see attached except of GC28-0627-2 OS/VS2 MVS Sys Pgm
           manual for full description.

    xxxx - Eye-catcher text for representing error thrown code point.


SVC 99 Return Codes*
===================

Note: The labels used in this topic are assigned by macros IEFZB4D0
      and IEFZB4D2.

When the SVC 99 routines return control to the requesting program,
register 15 contains a return code. Depending on the return code,
the S99ERROR and S99INFO fields in the input request block (S99RB)
may additionally contain error and information reason codes
respectively. The return codes that can be returned in register 15
are shown in Figure 6.


Code    Meaning
----    ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  0     Successful completion; there will also be an information reason
        code if a non-terminating error occurred during request processing.

  4     An error resulted from the current environment, the unavailability
        of a system resource, or a system routine failure; there will also
        be an error reason code.

  8     The installation validation routine denied this request.
        (See "Installation Input Validation Routine" for additional
        information.)

 12     The error is due to an invalid parameter list; there will also be
        an error reason code from class 3. (Class 3 reason codes are
        listed in Figure 7.)
