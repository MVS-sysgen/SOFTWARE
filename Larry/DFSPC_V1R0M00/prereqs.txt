*     ISPF generic message ISRZ002, part of message member ISRZ00, is  
*  used for error message processing and posting by this software.
*  If ISRZ00 is NOT INSTALLED on your system, error posting results in     
*  a message not found condition with no error context posted.

*     This software displays date and time on line 1 using ISPF
*  Z-variables ZDATE, ZJDATE and ZTIME or subroutine GETDTE (if
*  installed on your system).
*
*     GETDTE, is OPTIONAL, and can be downloaded from website:

*     If GETDTE is installed, two user-mods, ZP60014 and ZP60038 are
*  REQUIRED to process CLIST symbolic variables via the IKJCT441 API.
*  Otherwise, GETDTE will function normally, but will NOT create 
*  CLIST variable, RDTEANSR.

*  the following website:
*       http://www.prycroft6.com.au/vs2mods/
