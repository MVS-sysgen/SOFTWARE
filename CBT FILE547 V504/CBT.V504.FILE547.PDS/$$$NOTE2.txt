Sam,

I have fixed a few bugs in the collection, and provided
a few more utilities.  The new utilities included are:

BSPAPFLS - List the APF datasets.  This is also
           integrated into BSPILOT
BSPOSCMD - Run OS commands from batch or STC
BSPPA2SI - JCL PARM to SysIn processor, takes JCL parm
           and makes it available in dataset for next step
MOVELOAD - Preload IEHMOVE modules for improved performance
REQUEUE  - requeue current job for later re-execution
BRODSCAN - Analyse SYS1.BRODCAST
DELAY    - Lets job wait for a specified time
TAPEHDR  - display tape label info

The modules beginning with BSP.. have been written by
me, whereas the others were sent to me by somitcw@yahoo.com
for inclusion in the Turnkey System

     With kind Regards            |\      _,,,---,,_
