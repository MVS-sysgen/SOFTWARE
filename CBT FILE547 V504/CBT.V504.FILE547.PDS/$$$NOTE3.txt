We have included the Stage 1 SYSGEN deck for Volker Bandke's Turnkey
MVS 3.8 system, version 3.  It is member $SYSGEN1 in this pds.

The purpose for including Volker's Stage 1 SYSGEN deck, is so that
you can see which devices he has genned.  When you boot up the Turnkey
system, that information might not be so easy to find out, so here is
another way.....
