//***FILE 547 is from Volker Bandke, who has pioneered the easy     *   FILE 547
//*           setup of a Hercules Turnkey MVS system that runs      *   FILE 547

//*           This file of software has tools and JCL, and other    *   FILE 547
//*           stuff (such as the CMD Subsystem utilities) which     *   FILE 547
//*           run on MVS 3.8J, under Hercules, or a later MVS,      *   FILE 547
//*           to supplement Volker's Turnkey System.                *   FILE 547

//*           In case you don't know yet, Hercules is a freeware    *   FILE 547
//*           hardware emulator which allows you to run any flavor  *   FILE 547
//*           of MVS, VM, VSE, LINUX/390, or anything else which    *   FILE 547

//*           Of course, if you can't run an operating system       *   FILE 547
//*           because of licensing restrictions, at least, you      *   FILE 547
//*           can run free old versions of MVS, VM, or DOS/VS.      *   FILE 547

//*           That's what Volker's Turnkey MVS system makes it      *   FILE 547
//*           easy to do.  Volker already did a Full SYSGEN, and    *   FILE 547
//*           has set up a completely configured MVS system, which  *   FILE 547
//*           you can load up and run on your PC, just by answering *   FILE 547
//*           a few questions.  Setup time is a few minutes, and    *   FILE 547
