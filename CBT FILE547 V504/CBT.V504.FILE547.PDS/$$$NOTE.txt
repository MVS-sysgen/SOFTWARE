MVS on your PC - Turnkey MVS System Utilities

Fortune Cookies, R2D2, and other goodies

BSP38J - The Archive

You can download the archive as a zip or a tar file. The
contents in both files are identical

   * bsp38j.aws - a hercules tape file
   * bsp38j.jcl - JCL to load the tape to your MVS system
   * bsp38j.map - map of tape

Unpack the archive files into a directory of your
choice. Adjust the JCL to your needs. Then, at the
hercules console, enter

devinit 480,[yourdir/]bsp38j.aws
devinit 00c,[yourdir/]bsp38j.jcl eof

A Job should now be started that loads a few files into
your system.

When you use the supplied JCL to load the Addon Utility
tape to disk, the following files will be created

   * CBT.MVS38J.CNTL - JCL
   * CBT.MVS38J.ASM - Assembler Source
   * CBT.MVS38J.MACLIB - Assembler Macros
   * CBT.MVS38J.LOAD - Preassembled load modules

This collection assumes that you have installed the MVS
Turnkey system. It has been installed and tested in that
environment. If you haven't installed the MVS Turnkey
System, these files will most probably work as well, but,
you will have to do some adjustments to JCL procedures
etc

$$INSTAL in file CBT.MVS38J.CNTL
